Very Slow Movie Player

Inspired by:
* [How to Build a Very Slow Movie Player for Â£120 in 2020](https://debugger.medium.com/how-to-build-a-very-slow-movie-player-in-2020-c5745052e4e4) - Tom Whitwell
* [Creating a Very Slow Movie Player](https://medium.com/s/story/very-slow-movie-player-499f76c48b62) - Bryan Boyer

Hardware from:
* [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/) - E-Paper display
  * I have used [7.5inch e-Paper HAT V2](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.5inch_e-Paper_HAT), and [7.8inch e-Paper HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.8inch_e-Paper_HAT)
* [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) - Pi Zero W
  * Getting some headers is a good idea, for easily connecting the e-Paper HAT.
